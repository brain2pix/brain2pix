<b>Datasets:</b>

<b> Dr. Who: </b> The Dr. Who dataset is publicly available. The first author of the dataset paper (Seeliger et. al., 2019) mentioned (on http://disq.us/p/23bj45d) that the link will be activated soon. For now it is available by contacting them. 



<b> vim2: </b> This dataset was taken from http://crcns.org/, originally published by Nishimoto et. al, 2011.
